PROGRAM DETAILS
---------------

This program demonstrates the test-driven development process. A process that starts with
an initial test based on the program requirements. The main file (i.e. check_pwds.py) will
inevitably fail the test. In this case, you write just enough code in the main file to pass the most recently added test. Then you add another test from the requirements and 
repeat the process until all the requirements of the program are met.

This program checks passwords to make sure they are valid based on a set of requirements.
